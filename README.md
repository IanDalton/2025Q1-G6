## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

To deploy the project, navigate to the `terraform` folder and run the following command:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

> üïí **Note:**  
> The first deployment will take ~20 minutes due to the size of the backend.
> Grab a cup of coffee and relax.

Once the deployment is complete, the output in the console will include the relevant links (e.g., API endpoints).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è API Boot Delay
Even after the container is running, the API may take a few extra minutes to start responding.
This is expected behavior ‚Äî the backend takes a moment to fully boot up.
